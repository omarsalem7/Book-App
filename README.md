# MyReads Project
In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:
* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Have Read.
And each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.
The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.
The search page has a text input that may be used to find books. Along with a control that lets you add the book to your library.
he search page also has a link to / (the root URL), which leads back to the main page.

To get started developing right away:
